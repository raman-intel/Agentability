## 🚀 What is Agentability?

Agentability is the most comprehensive observability platform for multi-agent AI systems,
evolved from our learnings building agent frameworks.

### Why We Built This

After building garg-agenticai-framework and deploying agent systems to production, we
discovered the critical missing piece: **observability**. When agents fail in production,
you need to know WHY, not just WHAT happened.

Agentability solves this with:
- ✅ Temporal Causal Graphs (understand WHY decisions happened)
- ✅ Regression Detection (catch performance drops automatically)
- ✅ Semantic Search (find similar failures at scale)
- ✅ PII Protection (enterprise-ready security)
- ✅ Complete Memory Tracking (all 4 types)

## 📜 Project History

This project evolved from **garg-agenticai-framework**, our original agent framework
exploration. See [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md) for complete project timeline and rationale
for the pivot to observability.

All git history from the original project is preserved in this repository.
