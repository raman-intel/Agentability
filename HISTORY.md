# Project History: garg-agenticai-framework → Agentability

## Timeline

### Phase 1: garg-agenticai-framework (2024-2025)
**Original Project:** Agent framework development
**Repository:** garg-agenticai-framework
**Focus:** Early agent system experiments and prototyping

Key Commits:
- Initial framework setup
- Core agent implementations
- [Add specific milestones from your git log]

### Phase 2: Evolution to Agentability (Feb 2026)
**New Direction:** Production observability platform
**Repository:** Agentability (renamed from garg-agenticai-framework)
**Focus:** Agent observability, monitoring, and debugging

Major Changes:
- Pivoted to observability use case
- Implemented 6 core analyzers
- Added semantic search capabilities
- Enterprise security features

## Why the Transition?

The original garg-agenticai-framework laid groundwork for understanding
agent systems. This learning enabled us to identify the critical need for
observability in production multi-agent systems.

Agentability is the natural evolution - using deep agent expertise to
build tools that make agent systems production-ready.
