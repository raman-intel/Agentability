# Project History: garg-agenticai-framework → Agentability

## Timeline

### Phase 1: garg-agenticai-framework (2024-2025)
Original focus: Agent framework experimentation and prototyping.

### Phase 2: Agentability (February 2026)
New focus: Production observability for multi-agent AI systems.

## Why the Transition?

After building agent systems, we identified observability as the missing
production layer. When agents fail, teams need to understand WHY.

Agentability delivers:
- Temporal Causal Graphs
- Regression Detection
- Semantic Debug Search
- PII Detection & Redaction
- Complete Memory Tracking
